# Examples
This directory contains 3 small examples that show how to make a very basic application on Genesis, how to add gameloop objects and physics objects to it. If you need more advanced examples, such as input handling and factory manipulation, you can check out [**ArkanoidWithoutAnEngine**](https://github.com/Atennop1/ArkanoidWithoutAnEngine/tree/master), my full-fledged project written using Genesis.
