### About project
Genesis is a simple game engine based on SDL2 and written in modern C++. The engine is used in my own project ArkanoidWithoutAnEngine, it appeared when I was doing that project and soon decided to separate the system part into a separate solution, like my first small engine. It's supported on both Windows and Linux, and can be connected as a static library or as a dynamic one. It is also written in a strictly OOP style, with minimal distortions.
